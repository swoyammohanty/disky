# Changelog

All notable changes to disky are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `disky status` — native system dashboard (per-core CPU, memory, disk, battery,
  GPU, network throughput, top processes) with a 1–100 health score
  (mole `status` parity).
- `disky sweep` — reclaim space from system/app caches, logs, and trash
  (mole `clean` parity), with dry-run, exclusions, and audit logging.
- `disky installer` — find and remove installer files (.dmg/.pkg/.iso) in
  Downloads/Desktop/Homebrew cache.
- `disky analyze [path]` — read-only disk-usage overview (whole-volume capacity
  bar) plus the largest files under a path, tagged with insights.
- Live scan progress (CLI spinner + TUI), auto-JSON when piped, an operation
  audit log (`~/.disky/operations.log`), and an insight engine.
- SOLID foundation: macOS platform-services layer, scan-provider model +
  orchestrator, cleaner-strategy model + shared CleanService.
- Clean safety policy with protected-path guarding (`auto`/`inspect`/`locked`
  classification with human-readable reasons).
- Engineering foundation: committed test suite, GitHub Actions CI (typecheck, lint,
  format, test+coverage, build, gitleaks secret scan), ESLint + Prettier, vitest coverage
  thresholds, pre-commit hook, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Competitive analysis vs. mole and a UX improvement guide under `docs/`.

### Changed

- `npm run lint` now runs ESLint (was `tsc --noEmit`, now `npm run typecheck`).
- Codebase formatted with Prettier.
- Stopped tracking `node_modules/` in git.

## [1.0.2]

- Lazygit-style multi-panel TUI; core scan/clean/detail/watch commands; Docker reclaim
  detection.
